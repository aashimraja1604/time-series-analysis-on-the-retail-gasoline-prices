- The code is performing a time series analysis on the retail gasoline prices data obtained from the Energy Information Administration (EIA) website. 
- It downloads the data as a pandas dataframe, preprocesses it, normalizes it using StandardScaler, and then trains a LSTM model on 96% of the data and tests it on the remaining 4%. 
- The code calculates the mean squared error between the actual prices and the prices predicted by the model and outputs the root mean squared error. 
- Finally, it creates a combined list of the predicted prices from both the training and the test sets and plots the actual and predicted prices.

`Crude oil price forecasting is indeed affected by a variety of factors beyond just historical data, including geopolitical events, natural disasters, and accidents, among others. Not accounting for these factors in your model can result in a less accurate prediction. It's important to consider all relevant factors when making predictions about crude oil prices or any other complex phenomenon.`

- I can overcome from this problem buy appling this approch.
- Another approach could be to model the relationship between crude oil prices and geopolitical events using a time series model, such as a Vector Autoregression (VAR) model. This would allow you to capture the lagged relationship between crude oil prices and geopolitical events, and incorporate these relationships into your price forecasting model.

- In any case, incorporating these additional factors into your model would likely require significant additional data gathering, pre-processing, and modeling efforts, and it is important to carefully validate your model to ensure that it is producing accurate and reliable predictions.
